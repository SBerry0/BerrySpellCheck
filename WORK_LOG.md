| Sep 23 |  1:00-1:45pm  | I started by thinking about my answer to the quiz question that we had that was similar to this, and how I could use a tree-like structure to keep track of each character then go through that to search the dictionary. At first I approached the tree first, then the dictionary, but that was really dumb because I would still have to check if the word existed. So then, I pivoted to building up the tree as I iterated through the dictionary. Now I have to test to see if the tree actually results in what I want. |
| Sep 23 |  4:00-4:45pm  |                                                                                                                              I found a small bug in my tree creation process, then created the searching idea for checking if a word is in the dictionary or not. I'm pretty sure there are no bugs now as it passes the first test, but the creation of the tree takes a really long time. I went through the debugger and found a bug that didn't change the current node properly, but even after that, it ran really slow. |
| Sep 25 | 11:00-11:30pm |                                                                                                                             I thought a possibility for the cause of the slowness could be when I was checking if there was a letter in the child of a node. I used linear search initially because I figured it wouldn't be that bad with a maximum of 26 letters, but maybe that's why it runs slow. So, I tried to create a binary search for it instead because they are already sorted. It doesn't work right now though. |
| Sep 26 |  8:15-9:15pm  |                                                                  I spent a lot of time in the debugger before I finally figured out that the index of the middle was being set to the end and was skipping a choice. I tried to figure out a solution and used checks for it as well, but none of them worked without running into an index out of bounds error or returning the wrong values still. Eventually I gave up and started researching hash sets a little because I'm convinced this isn't a graph problem anymore. |
| Sep 29 |  4:45-6:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                          I realized there was a lot more things that I could do to make what I now know is a trie faster. I made maps and some extra checks in this new version. It still isn't fast enough, but I think it's because I'm not using a trie for the mispelled words. This would require me to turn a trie into its own class so that's what I'm starting to do. |
| Sep 30 |  2:30-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I didn't have to change very much of my code to fit it into a trie class. I havent' tested it yet, but I have to make each trie first then see if it works. |
| Oct 1  |  4:15-5:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I debugged it for a while, going through the debugger to see the structure of the tree, and I found a bug with the way I was labelling the end word, but now that's fixed. Now I have to figure out how to turn a trie into an array to return the actual values in the mispelled trie. |
| Oct 2  | 12:30-1:10pm  |                                                                                                                                                       I realized I did a stupid and the errors have nothing to do with the printing. I don't need to figure out the printing, I can just use the debugger. From that I found that I had been mixing up some trues and falses in my lookup, so I was returning the opposite value in some instances. Now the trie fully works and passes all the cases, time to work on the TST |
| Oct 2  |  1:15-1:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                        I started work on the TST, making the classes and starting the insert method of the TST. I think I have an idea and I'm getting close. Going to test what I have right now, doubting it works but it will give me a standing of where I am. I also found a mistake in the Trie where I was using an array of size 1 instead of just a variable, no clue why I did that. |
| Oct 4  |  7:00-8:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                  I found that I just wasn't connecting any of the nodes together through the TST. I changed the way I connected the nodes and now I'm using an array because I just think it's easier. Insertion is close to working, I'm just comparing the letter one too deep so it isn't going all the way down equals for the first word. |

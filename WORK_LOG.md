| Sep 23 |  1:00-1:45pm  |                                 I started by thinking about my answer to the quiz question that we had that was similar to this, and how I could use a tree-like structure to keep track of each character then go through that to search the dictionary. At first I approached the tree first, then the dictionary, but that was really dumb because I would still have to check if the word existed. So then, I pivoted to building up the tree as I iterated through the dictionary. Now I have to test to see if the tree actually results in what I want. |
| Sep 23 |  4:00-4:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                              I found a small bug in my tree creation process, then created the searching idea for checking if a word is in the dictionary or not. I'm pretty sure there are no bugs now as it passes the first test, but the creation of the tree takes a really long time. I went through the debugger and found a bug that didn't change the current node properly, but even after that, it ran really slow. |
| Sep 25 | 11:00-11:30pm |                                                                                                                                                             I thought a possibility for the cause of the slowness could be when I was checking if there was a letter in the child of a node. I used linear search initially because I figured it wouldn't be that bad with a maximum of 26 letters, but maybe that's why it runs slow. So, I tried to create a binary search for it instead because they are already sorted. It doesn't work right now though. |
| Sep 26 |  8:15-9:15pm  |                                                                                                  I spent a lot of time in the debugger before I finally figured out that the index of the middle was being set to the end and was skipping a choice. I tried to figure out a solution and used checks for it as well, but none of them worked without running into an index out of bounds error or returning the wrong values still. Eventually I gave up and started researching hash sets a little because I'm convinced this isn't a graph problem anymore. |
| Sep 29 |  4:45-6:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                          I realized there was a lot more things that I could do to make what I now know is a trie faster. I made maps and some extra checks in this new version. It still isn't fast enough, but I think it's because I'm not using a trie for the mispelled words. This would require me to turn a trie into its own class so that's what I'm starting to do. |
| Sep 30 |  2:30-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I didn't have to change very much of my code to fit it into a trie class. I havent' tested it yet, but I have to make each trie first then see if it works. |
| Oct 1  |  4:15-5:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I debugged it for a while, going through the debugger to see the structure of the tree, and I found a bug with the way I was labelling the end word, but now that's fixed. Now I have to figure out how to turn a trie into an array to return the actual values in the mispelled trie. |
| Oct 2  | 12:30-1:10pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                       I realized I did a stupid and the errors have nothing to do with the printing. I don't need to figure out the printing, I can just use the debugger. From that I found that I had been mixing up some trues and falses in my lookup, so I was returning the opposite value in some instances. Now the trie fully works and passes all the cases, time to work on the TST |
| Oct 2  |  1:15-1:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                        I started work on the TST, making the classes and starting the insert method of the TST. I think I have an idea and I'm getting close. Going to test what I have right now, doubting it works but it will give me a standing of where I am. I also found a mistake in the Trie where I was using an array of size 1 instead of just a variable, no clue why I did that. |
| Oct 4  |  7:00-8:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I found that I just wasn't connecting any of the nodes together through the TST. I changed the way I connected the nodes and now I'm using an array because I just think it's easier. Insertion is close to working, I'm just comparing the letter one too deep so it isn't going all the way down equals for the first word. |
| Oct 5  |  1:00-2:00pm  |                                                                                                                                               I tried a few things to fix the depth at which I was checking the letters like incrementing and decrementing at certain points in the loop, and that solved the problem of the first word being inserted. However, the next words did not go in correctly and there were a lot of duplicate letters. So, I'm pivoting after rereading the sedgewick paper you gave us and I'm going to try to do it recursively. |
| Oct 5  |  2:15-3:30pm  |                                             The insertion FINALLY works, I'm glad I pivoted to using recursion. It took a while to figure out what to do to get the wordend setting to true, but I figured it out eventually. I won't know for certain if it fully works until I get the getting method working, but from looking through the debugger it looks good. I realized the reason that this recurion didn't run into the same problem I was having was because I could control the depth much easier and I only incremented it when I found a match. |
| Oct 5  |  6:30-7:15pm  | I finally finished it!!! The lookup wasn't too different from the insertion, but I ran into a problem where I was prematurely returning a null value instead of checking it. It took a while but I figured out it was the order I had by basecases in because I was checking the last letter of the program and returning if it was at the end of the word or not before it had actually been found by the TST. Now I pass all of the tests with the TST and the trie. I'm going to make a few more optimizations with the TST then comments and I'll be done. |

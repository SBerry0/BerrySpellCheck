| Sep 23 | 1:00-1:45pm | I started by thinking about my answer to the quiz question that we had that was similar to this, and how I could use a tree-like structure to keep track of each character then go through that to search the dictionary. At first I approached the tree first, then the dictionary, but that was really dumb because I would still have to check if the word existed. So then, I pivoted to building up the tree as I iterated through the dictionary. Now I have to test to see if the tree actually results in what I want. |

| Sep 23 |  1:00-1:45pm  | I started by thinking about my answer to the quiz question that we had that was similar to this, and how I could use a tree-like structure to keep track of each character then go through that to search the dictionary. At first I approached the tree first, then the dictionary, but that was really dumb because I would still have to check if the word existed. So then, I pivoted to building up the tree as I iterated through the dictionary. Now I have to test to see if the tree actually results in what I want. |

I'm pretty sure there are no bugs now as it passes the first test, but the creation of the tree takes a really long time. I went through the debugger and found a bug that didn't change the current node properly, but even after that, it ran really slow. |

I used linear search initially because I figured it wouldn't be that bad with a maximum of 26 letters, but maybe that's why it runs slow. So, I tried to create a binary search for it instead because they are already sorted. It doesn't work right now though. |
